            <h1>soph week 4/28 - 5/2</h1>
            <p> missed monday, limited work this week.</p>

            <h2> wings </h2>
            <p>after testing the 3d printed wings, the gap between them felt awkward, so i merged them into a single piece.</p>
            
            <div class="two-imgs">

                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/14/shell_new.PNG">
            </div>

            <h6>original wings (left) vs new merged design (right)</h6>
            <p>also reintroduced trigger stands with larger pegs for better durability. added small rectangular blockers to the pcb stands to prevent movement - these should lock the pcb in place while allowing removal.</p>
            <p>test prints of the updated shell and triggers:</p>

                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/14/shellwithpcb.jpeg">
            </div>   

            <h2>trigger adjustments</h2>

            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/14/triggers.PNG">
            <p>fixed the length miscalculation (eyeballed ~2mm {which is still too small}) from last print (though forgot to implement before printing). also modified the angle to reduce overhang, which slightly decreased the button surface area.</p>
            <p>had to relocate the stands to accommodate these changes - hopefully this doesn’t cause issues later.</p>

            <h2> solder fail</h2>

            <div class="two-imgs">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/14/soulderback.jpeg">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/14/soulderfront.jpeg">
            </div>   

            <p>tried resoldering the pcb for sensor testing. and well, it failed. </p>
            <p>thankfully <a href="https://www.mileshilliard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> miles</a> offered to help with resoldering. hoping the pcb isn’t permanently damaged. (thank you so much)</p>

            <h2> errors to fix?</h2>
            <p>in order to add the stands to stabilize the pcb, i had to increase the length of the original stands a lot, resulting in the led potentially being too high and not hitting the sensor block.</p>
            <p>this is gonna be something i have to check over when i get a working usb wire (hopefully my board still works) which may take a bit.</p>
            <p>additionally i’m hoping that the mouse triggers and shell with the stands are able to print without any blemishes or major imperfections.</p>
            <p>besides putting it all together and testing, i’m slowly creeping closer to finishing this project.</p>
