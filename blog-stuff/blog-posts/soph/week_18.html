            <h1>soph week 6/2-6/6</h1>
            <p>got most of my things transfered from my previous linux installation into mint so i could finally start working on things again.</p>
            <p>i have an idea of what i want to do junior and senior year, so i wanted to finish the zeromouse soon.</p>
            <p>errors occured though, and with the limited time due to eventual half days, finals, and other tests, this week was slightly shorter for me.</p>

            <h2> trigger </h2>
            <p>so, as you can recall from my blog post, the dimensions were a bit off.</p>
            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/18/left_old.PNG">
            <p>fixing this issue fixed my problem, and i decided to try a new mechanism to attach the pcb to the stands.</p>

            <p>first, i wanted to test the print to make sure that my idea could be printed without supports.</p>
            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/18/broken.jpeg">
            <p>while printing, someone told me that my print for some reason got evicted off of the build plate, and stopped printing halfway.</p>
            <p>so, some friends suggested that i use brim, and after some supervision, it turned out quite well.</p>

            <div class="two-imgs">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/18/new1.jpeg">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/18/new2.jpeg">
            </div>

            <h2> new idea </h2>
            <p>rather than making a massive shell, i wanted to try a new approach and extend the bottom of the triggers to try and avoid making a huge shell.</p>
            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/18/idea.jpg">
            <h6>this is from optimum’s new zeromouse blade, i kinda wanna do something like this</h6>
            <p>however, i will still have to create some sort of base for the sensor (as this is a cheap mouse).</p>

            <p>in the end, the mouse looked like this: </p>
            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/18/LEFT.PNG">
            <p>however, printing this will be a problem, as there will be overhang that i probably cannot avoid.</p>
            <p>now that the left trigger was done, a simple mirror would allow me to finish the right trigger right?</p>
            <p>well, the pcb is weird, and the hole on each side is different, so i had to edit the bottom part of the right side a bit.</p>

            <div class="two-imgs">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/18/right_problems.PNG">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/18/fixed_right.PNG">
            </div>

            <p>now that my triggers are done, i can start extending and making the “shell” for the mouse. additionally, i still need to figure out a minimalistic way to add the sensor holder and a way to print the mouse.</p>
