            <h1>soph week 4/1 - 4/4</h1>
            <p>birthday + no school monday, so shorter week.</p>

            <h2>zerømouse updates</h2>
            <p>last week, i mentioned three problems that i had with my first print</p>            
            <p>1. the size is really short… like way shorter than i thought</p>
            <p>2. the standoffs for the pcb aren’t aligned properly (mainly because i suck at measuring)</p>
            <p>3. the holder for the sensor was a bit small, and there was only one layer of print for it</p>
            <p>so i decided to address these problems and reprint.</p>

            <h2>test print two</h2>

            <div class="two-imgs">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/11/sensor.jpeg">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/11/print2.jpeg">
            </div>

            <p>so i fixed the size issue on my shell, and i’m liking it a lot more.</p>
            <p>also, i finished the sensor holder, as it holds it perfectly.</p>
            <p>however, there are still a few problems on my print, as the standoffs were still slightly missaligned and were too short</p>
            <p>i initally didn’t think that height would be a problem, but even forcing the pcb to fix in all four standoffs, they pcb would not stay on the shell with the sensor block on the shell. to fix this, i increased the height of the standoffs from 3mm to 5.5mm and reprinted.</p>

            <h2>test print three</h2>
            <p>i decided to downscale the model as i only needed to test the standoff height with the sensor, so i minimized the model as much as possible. additionally, i decreased the distance between the top two standoffs by 0.05mm</p>
            
            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/11/test.jpeg">

            <p>this ended up being perfect. both the distances between the standoffs and the height of the standoffs worked amazingly with the sensor block inside the shell.</p>
            <p>going forward, i need to work on the mouse clicks (both left and right buttons).</p>

            <h2>mouse buttons</h2>
            <p>so i created a rough model of the mouse buttons, but ended up hating it.</p>
            <p>instead, i found a really nice model consisting of mouse buttons, so going forward, i’m gonna be recreating my shell to fit with the mouse buttons instead of creating my own mouse buttons.</p>

            <div class="two-imgs">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/11/old.png">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/11/new.png">
            </div>

            <h6>left side was my original attempt at mouse buttons. right side are the mouse buttons i’ll be using moving forward from now</h6>
            <p>due to the stand on the pcb for the scroll wheel, i had to create a hole(?) thing which ended up looking really ugly. additionally, the mouse clicks i made weren’t slanted which wouldn’t be practical. while it could be adjusted, i hated my original design and was unsure how to fix it.</p>
            <p>i’m going to try and recreate my shell on this new document, and get both the mouse buttons and shell printed together to test everything and make sure it works.</p>
