            <h1>soph week 2/3 - 2/7</h1>
            <p> should finish my lightbox by next week. just a few more things to do.</p>

            <h2> schematic </h2>
            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/5/schem.png">
            <p>just a simple schematic. while preparing to mill my pcb, mr. christy suggested that using power and ground symbols would help clean up my schematic. i also ran into some issues during the milling process because i used incorrect components, as i hadn’t taken the time to set up an electronic library.</p>

            <h2> pcb errors</h2>
            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/5/error_1.png">
            <p>the image above shows my pcb with several errors. the primary issue was that the traces were too thick, leaving insufficient clearance between components. although i could have enlarged the pcb to resolve these problems, i preferred the compact design and opted to reduce the trace width to 35mils instead of 50mils.</p>

            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/5/error_2.png">
            <p> after addressing those errors, five new ones appeared. these were caused by using the wrong components, as i hadn’t properly managed my electronic library (as mentioned earlier). once i fixed this, all errors were resolved, and the pcb was ready for milling.</p>
            
            <div class="two-imgs">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/5/no_errors.png">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/5/3dpcb.png">
            </div>

            <p>once the pcb was milled, most of my time was spent crimping the power and ground wires and replacing the neopixel with a lightstrip. i also designed a power mechanism to supply energy to the board. unfortunately, there were no aux connectors available, so adding an aux power option wasn’t possible.</p>

            <p>after milling my pcb, i spent most of my time crimping the power and ground wires together, while also swapping the neopixel to a lightstrip. following this, i created a power mechanism in order to power up my board. sadly, there were no aux connectors, so making an aux connector to power my board wouldn’t have been possible.</p>

            <h2>acrylic piece</h2>
            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/5/piece.png">

            <p>with the pcb complete, the final steps are to 3d print the box and finish the acrylic piece. i’ll start printing the box soon, as i can work on the acrylic piece simultaneously. by the end of next week, everything should be ready for assembly.</p>
