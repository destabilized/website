            <h1>soph week 4/14 - 4/18</h1>
            <p>short post since i won't be here tomorrow. made good progress this week tho.</p>

            <h2> grip (wings)</h2>
            <p>finally added the “wings” i mentioned last week. </p>
            
            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/13/full_3d.png">
            <p>this completes the mouse shell design. still need to figure out trigger attachment (more below), though resin printing might make that unnecessary. my initial attachment idea didn’t work well.</p>
            
            <h2> printed parts</h2>

            <div class="two-imgs">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/13/full.jpeg">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/13/triggers.jpeg">
            </div>
            
            <p>tried using small stands and pegs to attach the triggers, but they were too thin (.95mm) and fragile - broke with slight pressure. the holes also came out weird.</p>
            <p>to fix this, i decided to increase the thickness of the button part of my triggers while also simultaneously increasing the distance between the stand/hole with the sides.</p>
            
            <h2> trigger problems</h2>
            <p> i couldn't just extrude the face to increase the thickness due to the upward angle of the triggers.</p>
            
            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/13/problem.png">

            <h6>notice how as the trigger starts angling upwards, a gap forms</h6>
            <p>this was a major problem that i wasn’t originally sure how to solve, as i wasn’t able to print like this, but didn’t know what the problem was.</p>
            <p>eventually with mr.l’s help, i got the trigger’s thickness to increase: utilized an offset plane and projecting both the face and the intercept and connecting the two faces, extruding them to each other.</p>
            <p>now the triggers (should) work, just need to add pegs/holes for attachment.</p>
            
            <div class="two-imgs">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/13/fixedv1.png">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/13/fixedv2.png">
            </div>
            
            <h2>other problems</h2>
            <p>with the new shell and triggers, i tested the pcb and found some other problems.</p>
            <p>1. pcb stability: needed to secure the pcb against the sensor block because it was loose.</p>
            <p>2. trigger length: didn't account for sensor block height, and now it prevents clicking</p>
            
            <p>by solving these two problems and resoldering the original pcb back up, i should be done. i may add a circle thingy(?) for the wires to cleanly flow through.</p>
            <p>additionally, i’m thinking of stealing a <a href="https://zeromouse.co/products/carbon-scroll?_pos=1&_sid=fd2b3dc77&_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scroll wheel</a> and resin printing it to put with my mouse (assuming it fits given my dimensions, as it was designed for a different mouse)</p>
