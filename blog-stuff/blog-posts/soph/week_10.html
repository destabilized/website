            <h1>soph week 3/24 - 3/28</h1>
            <p>slow week since my partner focused more on the rov than our sumobot, so i went back to working on my zeromouse project.</p>
            
            <h2>sumobot updates</h2>

            <img src="../../../static/img/soph/10/pcb_fixed.png">

            <p>during our blog post presentations, my friend miles spotted an issue with my button wiring. turns out i was using a faulty button footprint with incorrect wiring. after switching to the right footprint and fixing the connections, the pcb shouldn’t have any shorts now.</p>
            <p>jonas (my partner) also printed the pcb holder for our sumobot, so i’ll be milling the board soon.</p>
            
            <h2> zerømouse</h2>
            <p>in my previous blogpost on the zeromouse, there were a bunch of errors that i had to deal with this week</p>
            <p> size is too short, standoffs aren't aligned properly, and the sensor holder is too small.</p>
            <p> i started by resizing and cleaning up the frame design to then fix these problems</p>
            
            <div class="two-imgs">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/10/old.png">
                <img src="../../../static/img/soph/10/new_sketch.png">
            </div>
            <h6> old sketch vs new sketch. old sketch on the left.</h6>
            <p>i also tried a new standoff design since i didn’t like the bulky filled lines from before, while hopefully fixing the alignment issues.</p>
            <p>the sensor mount isn’t added yet, but i’m using a thicker shell to avoid the structural problems from last time.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>hopefully next week i’ll have a test body and wheels for the sumobot, and i can test print this new mouse shell.</p>
